# osu! auto grid mapper
this was a small project i wanted to create just to see the possibilities of auto generated mapping in osu!
i do not plan on making this a well maintained project, but i do want to make it accessible.
i am also not very experienced with python or good code so please excuse my mess

# requirements
this program requires python 3.8.x, other versions probably will not work (3.9.x will not). check your python version with:
```
python --version
```

assuming you have pip, simply open the cloned directory and enter this command to install dependencies
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

# usage
as of now all the python files are jumbled into the same directory, sorry
- copy an .mp3 or .wav file that you want to create the map for into the cloned directory and make note of the filename
- next, use the command (keep the exact filename format of title.mp3 and do not add any \'s or .'s)
```
python main.py --filename yourfile.mp3
```
- follow the prompt instructions
- program will output the osu hit objects into a hitobjects.txt
- copy these hitobjects into your .osu map file (slider velocity of 1.3 is required and use only a single red line timing point)

i will make it output an actual map file soon
